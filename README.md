# Fetch
Fetch, a social network for dogs (and the owners who love them), was conceived at General Assembly during the Web Development Immersive program. Fetch gives dogs (and their owners) the opportunity to connect for doggy play dates.

Fetch was built with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.
