# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# users = User.create([
#   { email: "jasper@example.com",
#     fname: "Jasper",
#     lname: "Jepperson",
#     dog_name: "Droid",
#     bio: "My name's Droid and my dad's name is Jasper.  I'm a pup!",
#     password: "password",
#     password_confirmation: "password",
#     profile_pic: File.open("/Users/shawnrodriguez/Dropbox/fetch-photos/cropped_images(USE_THESE_IMAGES)/10375758_669194146483973_537718263_n.jpg")
